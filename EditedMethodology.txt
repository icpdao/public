2.2„ÄÅMethodology üìù

Perhaps it is not in-depth, or it is due to character. 
When understanding the content of traditional management and sociology, there is always a puzzle of circular argumentation. 
Until one day when I read KK‚Äôs "Out of Control", all of a sudden, everything became clear. 
The coveted organization could be like the ant colony described by EOWilson in "Ant Society", without central control, coordination, and no need to search for relationships, nor approvals, and complicated strategies. 
Each individual decides his behavior according to these simple rules. But in the end, surprising results can abruptly emerge complex and scientific ant nests and efficient foraging paths. 
Therefore, we firmly believe that a complex system (organization) with vitality stems exist from simple rules and bottom-up evolution. 
Simple rules make the emerging space bigger, and bottom-up evolution allows everyone to be respected. Inspire each other, iterate, and spiral upward.
Hayek once quoted... "It is not our current knowledge that can reveal the best solution to us, but new discoveries that have emerged through free attempts." 
Therefore, we do not naively think that we can simulate and predict the results of emergence effects through mathematical algorithms, but rather use the time to practice and explore.
